2) No

3) Navigation mode will analyze a page right after it loads, only providing a performance metric, but Snapshot mode will analyze a page in its current state, to find accessibility issues at a specific point in time.

4) We could properly size images to reduce load time, use images with more optimized formats like webp instead of jpeg or png, and reduce JavaScript execution time through strategies like removing unused code.
